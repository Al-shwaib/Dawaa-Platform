## General Overview

Patients face significant challenges in identifying drugs, obtaining accurate information, and finding them in suitable pharmacies. The "Dawaa" platform addresses these issues through an intelligent system that integrates artificial intelligence techniques (especially image processing and OCR) to facilitate drug recognition, search, and provide up-to-date pharmaceutical and health information, in addition to supporting pharmacists and medical students.
